## Feature Tasks and Requirements




Your task is to create a baseline classification model by following (and modifying when needed) the Practical

Text Classification With Python and Keras tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.

To accomplish your primary task you’ll need install several libraries and external assets.

A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.

Because most of the time that’s what internet is going to give you.

## Implementation Notes

You are only required to build the Baseline Model

Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.

Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.

Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them.
